name: render-tufte-chart
description: Produce a real, publication-ready data graphic (native PowerPoint objects, SVG, or HTML) that obeys Tufte's principles — minimal ink, range-frame axes, direct labels, honest proportions. Use whenever someone wants to design, build, create, draw, or actually produce a chart the Tufte way, or to rebuild a chart after assessment found problems. This is the only skill in the toolkit that outputs an actual chart.

# Render Tufte Chart

This skill produces an actual chart file. It is the toolkit's output stage: the
router sends "design / build / produce a chart" requests here, and an
optimisation workflow ends here (assess to diagnose, render to rebuild).

The old version of this skill shipped Python that called undefined functions and
could not run. It is replaced by a working script plus clear construction guidance.

## Output target decides the medium (decide this first)

Pick the medium before the genre - it changes how you build.

- **Into a PPTX deck (the default in this workflow): build native PowerPoint
  objects with PptxGenJS. This is the preferred output.** Do not render an SVG
  or PNG and drop it on the slide as a picture. Native objects stay editable in
  PowerPoint, inherit the deck's theme fonts and colours, render crisp at any
  zoom, and avoid the patchy SVG support and font substitution you get from
  embedded images.
- **Non-pptx target (a paper, a web page, a portable single file): emit SVG, or
  the HTML wrapper.** The Python scripts below exist for exactly this.

Tufte-correct native pptx is fully achievable and is the path to prefer:

- Use native chart objects (`addChart`) stripped to minimal ink - no gridlines,
  no chart border, no legend, thin line weights, white or no fills, colour used
  functionally only.
- The constructions a native chart can't express directly - direct labels (B4),
  range-frame axes (B2), the erased quartile box (C1), dot-dash marginals (C3),
  series end-labels - are composed from native shapes: thin lines spanning the
  data range, text boxes placed on the marks, small rectangles or ticks. All
  native, all editable.
- Treat the SVG scripts below as the geometry reference for what to reproduce
  with PptxGenJS shapes when a native chart can't carry the construction.

Everything in the build checklist and genre table applies to both media - only
the emitter changes.

## Build checklist (apply every time)

These bake in the principles from `references/tufte-principles.md` so the chart
never needs cleanup afterwards. Read that file for the full reasoning.

- **Honest proportions (B1).** Bars/columns start at a zero baseline. Encode a
  1-D quantity with length or position, never with 2-D area or 3-D volume.
- **Range-frame axes (B2).** Axis lines span exactly the data range, ends
  labelled; no outward padding. Exception: keep zero baseline for bar value axes.
- **Direct labels (B4).** Label lines at their endpoints and bars beside the bars;
  do not emit a separate legend.
- **Minimal ink (B5).** White background, no gridlines (or faint hairlines at
  major ticks only), no border box, no 3-D, no shadows, no gradients.
- **One encoding per datum (B6).** Don't restate a value with fill + border +
  label; keep the strongest channel.
- **Many series → small multiples (B3).** Repeat one shrunken design with shared
  scales rather than overplotting; order frames meaningfully.
- **Money over time (B7).** If the series is currency across years, convert to
  real terms first (use `scripts/deflate.py` with retrieved CPI) and label the
  axis "real <base-year> <currency>".
- **Inert SVG (B8).** *(SVG path only - native pptx objects have no script
  surface.)* No `<script>`, no event-handler attributes (`onload=`
  etc.), no `javascript:` URLs, no `<foreignObject>`, no SMIL `<animate>`/
  `<set>`. The four scripts above never emit these; if you hand-build SVG for
  one of the "other genres" below, keep it inert too — `wrap_html.py` will
  refuse to wrap anything carrying active content.

## Design to the message, not just from the data

When the chart is bound for a slide, take the slide's **action title, message,
and emphasis series** as build inputs, not context. A chart designed from data
alone proves the message only incidentally; a chart designed to the message
puts the asserted figure or delta where the eye lands first - direct labels on
the emphasis series, the title number visibly derivable from the marks. If the
title asserts "cost falls 22%", the 22% delta is the most prominent thing on
the graphic.

When rebuilding after an assessment (or when the orchestrator hands back ranked
fixes), address **every listed fix** in priority order - each is tagged with the
Tufte remedy (B-code) or genre switch (C-code) to apply - and do not regress
anything that already passed. A rebuild that ignores its fix list converges by
luck.

## Pick the genre first

Before writing any code, check `references/tufte-principles.md` Part C and
choose Tufte's genre that fits the data shape. The toolkit ships a working
script for the four genres below; for the rest, build the SVG by hand
following Part C's recipe.

| Data shape | Tufte genre (Part C) | Script |
|---|---|---|
| 1 × N over time | C10 time-series | `render_line_svg.py` |
| K series indexed by a category | C5 small multiples | `small_multiples.py` |
| Distributions of K groups | C1 quartile plot | `quartile_plot.py` |
| Bivariate / scatter | C2 range frame (+ optional C3 dot-dash marginals) | `range_frame.py` |
| Categorical 1-value | C9 white-grid bar / C6 supertable | hand-build SVG |
| ≤20 numbers total | C6 supertable | hand-build HTML/SVG |
| Many variables, geographic | F (Minard / Snow / Cancer Atlas) | hand-build SVG |

If the data is ≤20 numbers, **prefer a table** (VDQI p.56) — say so to the user
before rendering. If forced to graph, use C6 supertable, not pie/bar.

## Multi-render rule (when to produce N alternatives)

When the assess step flagged a "Multi-render trigger" (data shape with more
than one correct Tufte answer), **render both alternatives side-by-side** in
one output, then let the user pick. This is the discipline that prevents
quiet defaulting to the obvious genre.

| Data shape | Render BOTH |
|---|---|
| 1 number / single ratio | (a) a one-sentence prose statement with the number inline, and (b) a tiny inline visual — a one-row proportion bar or a small two-color dot square |
| ≤20 numbers | (a) a C6 supertable (with optional table-graphic sparkline column), and (b) a single Tufte chart (C8 + C2 range-frame dot plot, or C9 white-grid bar) |
| Many series of one x | (a) a C5 small-multiples grid, and (b) an overplotted line/dot chart with direct end-labels |
| Distributions across groups | (a) a C1 quartile plot, and (b) a strip plot or histogram |
| Bivariate scatter | (a) a C2 range frame, and (b) the C3 dot-dash variant adding marginals |

For all other data shapes, render one canonical Tufte form (don't manufacture
alternatives when one obviously dominates). When emitting both alternatives,
state in one sentence why each exists and what to look at in each — the goal
is letting the reader see the toolkit's range, not flooding them with
near-duplicates.

## How to render

The scripts below emit SVG - use them directly for non-pptx targets, and as the
geometry reference when building the same chart natively in PptxGenJS for a deck.

### Line / time-series (C10)

```
python scripts/render_line_svg.py \
  --data '[{"x":2000,"y":12.1},{"x":2023,"y":22.9}]' \
  --title "Revenue (real 2023 USD, M)" --series "Revenue" --out chart.svg
```

(Pass `--data-file path.json` for larger data. For monetary series, deflate the
values before passing them in.)

### Small multiples (C5) — "inevitably comparative, deftly multivariate"

Input is a flat list of records keyed by facet, x, and y:

```
python scripts/small_multiples.py \
  --data '[{"facet":"NA","x":1,"y":1000},{"facet":"EU","x":1,"y":900}, ...]' \
  --facet-key facet --x-key x --y-key y \
  --title "Daily active users by region" --cols 3 --out chart.svg
```

Frames are sorted by total y (descending) unless `--order "A,B,C"` is passed.
All frames share scales; axis end-labels appear only on the first frame to
avoid repeating ink.

### Quartile plot (C1) — Tufte's stripped-down box plot

Input is a JSON object mapping group name to list of values:

```
python scripts/quartile_plot.py \
  --data '{"Control":[2.3,2.5,...],"TreatmentA":[1.8,2.0,...]}' \
  --title "Reaction time (s) by condition" --out chart.svg
```

The box is erased; what remains is a single vertical stroke per group spanning
the full range, the IQR offset horizontally from it, and a median tick.

### Range-frame scatter (C2) — and optional dot-dash plot (C3)

```
python scripts/range_frame.py \
  --data '[{"x":1.2,"y":3.4},{"x":2.1,"y":4.5},...]' \
  --title "Body mass vs. wing span" \
  [--marginal-dash] --out chart.svg
```

`--marginal-dash` adds Tufte's dot-dash plot (VDQI p.133): marginal frequency
dashes along each axis framing the bivariate distribution.

### Other genres (bar, supertable, multivariate map, etc.)

Write the SVG/HTML directly, following Part C's recipe and the build checklist
above. Keep it a single self-contained file. A minimal pattern: white canvas,
thin dark data marks, range-frame axis lines with end labels, category/series
text placed on the marks, no grid/box.

## Optional: Tufte-styled HTML page

For a page that surrounds the chart with ET Book typography (and optional lede
text or caption), wrap the SVG with `scripts/wrap_html.py`. It uses the bundled
tufte-css (`assets/tufte-css/`, MIT-licensed) and copies the stylesheet and
fonts into a sibling `tufte-assets/` directory the first time so the result
opens correctly in any browser with no network:

```
python scripts/wrap_html.py \
  --svg chart.svg --out chart.html \
  --title "Revenue, 2000–2023" \
  --caption "Inflation-adjusted to 2023 USD using BLS CPI-U."
```

Use the SVG output when you need a portable single file (charts in a paper, a
slide deck, another site). Use the HTML wrapper when you want a self-contained,
browser-ready Tufte page (sharing a link, hosting a report). Pass `--no-assets`
if the page will be served from a site that already publishes `tufte.css` at
the expected path.

**If wrap_html refuses your SVG.** The wrapper accepts SVGs produced by the
four scripts above (they carry a trusted marker). If it exits with
`ERROR[untrusted-svg]`, the SVG wasn't produced by one of those — re-render
the chart with the matching script and try again. If you genuinely need to
wrap a hand-built or third-party SVG, pass `--untrusted`; the wrapper will
then run a best-effort active-content check and exit with `ERROR[active-svg]`
if it finds anything script-bearing. Either way, the fix is to produce inert
SVG (see B8 above).

Always save the file and tell the user its path. Where useful, follow up with
`assess-graphical-excellence` to confirm the result scores well.

## What good looks like

A graphic that carries no chartjunk, labels data directly, uses honest
proportions, and would itself pass an `assess-graphical-excellence` review -
built as native PowerPoint objects when it is bound for a deck (preferred), or
rendered to SVG/HTML for a non-pptx target.
